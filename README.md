Just another repository

I am Pavel Ivanov a student at the UNIVERSITY OF MINING AND GEOLOGY "ST. IVAN RILSKI". Currently I'm still familiarizing myself with the basics. I'm interested in geospatial analysis and open source GIS software. If anyone has info or shares the same interests as me on gis software development and likes produsts ot leading companies like ESRI or open source like the QGIS project maybe we can work together to make them better. Thank you!
